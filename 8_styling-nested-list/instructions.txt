We've provided you with the HTML, and we want you to:

1- Give the unordered list square bullets.

2- Give the unordered list items and the ordered list items a line-height of 1.5 of their font-size.

3- Give the ordered list lower alphabetical bullets.

4- Feel free to play with the list example as much as you like, experimenting with bullet types, spacing, or whatever else 
you can find.
