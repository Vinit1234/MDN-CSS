Steps breakdown on to build a website from the design:

1. Start with mobile first design. Keep checking your outputs 
on the specified size of mobile screen or less than 567px.
(Start writing code without worrying about refactoring.)

2. Start with layout implementation first. 
Use dummy data first and finish the layout. 
Use background colors, borders etc.
Check if it is responsive for mobile screens.

3. Now use media query for larger screens. Again start layout implementation.
Check if it is responsive for larger screens. Now check if implementations
for both the screens are working correctly. If not, fix them accordingly.

4. Now complete the details for mobile screen first.
Then complete the details for larger screens. Check for 
responsive nature for both mobile and larger screens.

5. Now go for refactoring - eliminate redundant code.
And make the code cleaner.
